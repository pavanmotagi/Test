## **Introduction**

The goal of Social Stock is to give you the sentiment analysis of a stock on Twitter and Reddit along with stock metrics, so that a trader can take advantage of the situation and profit. We now understand how social media affects stock prices considering the [GameStop affair](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/gamestop-reddit-explainer-what-s-happening-stock-market-n1255922). 
With the help of our platform, a trader can obtain the following information about his preferred stocks:
*	Sentiment score/Sentiment indicator value of Twitter and Reddit
*	Fundamental data and stock price metric related data of his choice of companies

The above information will help the trader in decision making.
